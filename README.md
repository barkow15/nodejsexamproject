# nodejsexamproject
Exam project for the elective Node.js Spring 2020

Name: DaysBySea
Description: The purpose of this application is to serve as a tool for kayaking. It will leverage the power of Firebase for Facebook user authentication and supply the tools necesary to complete logging and mapping tasks. For instance i can use the iPhone coded app to start and stop my route. That information will then be stored in Firebase and used by the application to show where i have been kayaking. Also i can do personal logging to each of the kayak log posts generated from the iPhone or i can create new ones but without the route traveled data.
